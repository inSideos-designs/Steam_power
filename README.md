# Steam Power Cleaning

A modern React + Vite experience for Steam Power Cleaning. The refreshed site now features a cart-based booking flow so visitors can bundle services, reserve time, and receive automated confirmations after checkout.

## Booking Flow Highlights

- Organize services by **Indoor**, **Outdoor**, **Automotive**, and **Add-On** categories covering carpets, tile, upholstery, windows, power washing, detailing, and take-home products.
- Build a personalized cart with quantity controls, realtime pricing, and estimated on-site duration before submitting.
- Collect contact details plus a preferred visit date, time, and time zone.
- Server-side booking endpoint validates availability through Google Calendar, creates the calendar event, and emails the customer a summary (charges still occur after service completion).
